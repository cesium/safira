Final Badge Challenge;You participate in talks and workshops, you talk with every company you can and participate in every tournament. Now you are left with a bunch of badges, what do you do?! Every badge comes with a set of entries to the Final Badge Draw! On the last day of SEI, we will select three winning entries and their owners will be the lucky recipients of an amazing selection of prizes! The more badges you have, the more likely you are to win!;global;
Daily Badge Challenge - Day One;This one is easy. The winners are the three people with the most badges won on the first day! If there is a tie, the participant with the most tokens wins! If there’s still a tie after that, we’ll toss a coin! The badges you win before SEI starts will be counted on this day.;daily;2025-02-11
Daily Badge Challenge - Day Two;The same rules as day one apply. However only the badges you win on the second day count towards this prize.;daily;2025-02-12
Daily Badge Challenge - Day Three;The same rules as day one (again). However only the badges you win on the third day count towards this prize.;daily;2025-02-13
Daily Badge Challenge - Day Four;This is getting a little repetitive… The same rules as day one (again). The difference is that only the badges you win on the fourth day count towards this prize.;daily;2025-02-14
